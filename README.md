This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Lua related to the `pairs` iterator and table modification.  The `pairs` iterator iterates over a table's key-value pairs. If the table is modified during iteration (e.g., by adding or removing elements), the iterator's behavior might become unpredictable.  The `bug.lua` file showcases this behavior, while `bugSolution.lua` offers a potential solution or workaround.  Understanding this behavior is critical for writing robust and predictable Lua code.
